      strong bundle
      |  is a quick and easy way to bundle your projects and see the minified and gzip size, it's similar to
      a(href="https://bundlephobia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener")  bundlephobia
      |  but does all the work locally on you computer and can treeshake multiple packages (both commonjs and esm) into a bundle, it also supports Typescript.

      a(href="https://github.com/rollup/rollup" target="_blank" rel="noopener")  rollup

      a(href="https://github.com/nodeca/pako" target="_blank" rel="noopener")  pako

      a(href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pretty-bytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener")  pretty-bytes
      |  to convert the gzip size to human readable values, and 
      a(href="https://github.com/mlomb/countapi-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener")  countapi-js
      |  to keep track of the number of page visits, in a private and secure way.
