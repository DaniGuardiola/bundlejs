import Anchor from "../components/Anchor";

You can also add bundle badges, they look like this,  
  
[![Open Bundle](/badge-light.svg)](https://bundlejs.com/) [![Open Bundle](/badge-dark.svg)](https://bundlejs.com/)

All you need to do is to add this to your `README.md`  

```md
# Light Mode Badge
[![Open Bundle](https://bundlejs.com/badge-light.svg)](https://bundlejs.com/)


# Dark Mode Badge
[![Open Bundle](https://bundlejs.com/badge-dark.svg)](https://bundlejs.com/)
```

You can use the <Anchor href="#sharing">Sharing</Anchor> section above, to create unique bundles, when users clicks on the badge.
